/*********************FaceID projects and Licence****************/
This project has no licence. Which means this program can be used or modified by anyone. But to help me my with works, I would be very pleased to be somehow "tagged" for my work.Thank you so much !

/******language and what FaceID is for*******/
FaceID is one of my GIU project using Python3. It's based on a facial recognition system which essentialy lists and stores faces v ia pictures and datas towards those faces. You can after identify those people via a Webcam or any other cameras. It also has other features in it.

/************Libraries(What you need to install)*************/
-> Tkinter/CustomTkinter for screen and GIU features and design.
-> Numpy, Matplotlib, PIL and SQL for data and matrice uses.
-> face_recognition, OpenCV and others for faciale features.
-> Threading, Time to control all events.


/*********Database Settings*****************/
In default, all the datas are on a local SQL - server.
Informations :
    Database name : FaceId_DB
         -> Table : Faces
                -> Columns : ID(int unsigned primary key), Marks(text), Age(text), Name(text).
/*********Notes************************/
This system is very sensitive(tolerance = 0.6/1). Which means it's not optimum. It has its own limits.If you really want to make sure the system will be able to distinct two faces, I invite to closely read my notes under the "Saving window". This is the fourth version and probably the latest. But of course I invite you to take a look on the previous ones so you can see the "plus" I add in this. Hope you enjoy it !
